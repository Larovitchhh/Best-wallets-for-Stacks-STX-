7. Hardware Wallets (Ledger, Tangem, etc.) — Best for Long-Term Security

If security first is your priority, consider hardware wallets that support STX (directly or via integration with software wallets like Xverse or Ledger Live). These devices store private keys offline — vastly reducing risk from online attacks. Options include:

Ledger Nano X / Ledger Stax (connects through apps)
CoinLore

Tangem Cards/Wallets — NFC-based hardware wallets with offline key storage.
