8. How to Choose the Right Wallet for You

Here are key factors to consider when picking your Stacks wallet:

Security vs. Convenience

Hardware wallets offer maximum security but are less convenient for daily use.

Software/mobile wallets are great for frequent transactions and interacting with dApps.

Features You Need

Stacking support — essential if you want to earn Bitcoin rewards by stacking STX.

NFT / dApp compatibility — important if you plan to engage with the ecosystem beyond holding tokens.

Control Over Keys

Non-custodial wallets (like Xverse or hardware wallets) mean you hold your private keys.

Custodial wallets or exchange wallets keep keys for you but at a trade-off in control.
Stacks

User Experience

Beginner-friendly wallets like Xverse are easier to learn. More advanced users might prefer wallets with broader features or deeper integrations.
